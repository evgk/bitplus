\section{Overview of the EVCCOIN project}
\subsection{Introduction}
EVCCOIN project was started as an attempt to simplify money transfers to and from Somalia. The mobile payment industry is flourishing now in Somalia, with solutions such as Hormuud’s EVC+ or Telesom’s Zaad. Those solutions act as a virtual, dollarized currency, and building a good bridge between decentralized, blockchain-based solutions such as Ethereum and those mobile payment solutions would allow to facilitate money transfers and other operations considerably.

\subsection{Project history}
EVCCOIN is the brainchild of Abdukadir Mohamed, a graduate of Simad University in Mogodishu. Abdukadir  has been one of the main advocates of blockchain technology in Somalia. Abdukadir has been an early adopter of technology and is one of the country's first internet users. From very early on, Abdukadir understood the vital role internet could play in changing the world.  In 2010, he purchased his first Bitcoin in 2010 and watched as the ecosystem developed. As a finance major, Abdukadir understood the problems involving Hawalas and money transmitters operating in western countries and how blockchain technology and Bitcoin could help connect Somalis to the world. 
At the time blockchain technology was new and many Somali businesses were skeptical. Despite this, Abdukadir successfully organized local events in an attempt to network and spread the adoption of this technology in his home country. He started working at a local radio station and began making plans to move to Kenya. In 2016, at a bitcoin meetup in Kenya, he met Abdi, a former executive at bank of America and director of Ocean Energy a oil and gas company. The two formed an alliance and started hashing out their ideas. He knows that he needs to save away his Bitcoin and find the investors needed to make this dream become a reality.

\subsection{Business overview}
\subsection{Technical overview}
The implementation that exists as of today is integrated with Bitcoin, and allows to trigger an EVCPLUS transfer by sending the money to a special temporary address that is generated for these purposes. However, as the Bitcoin network suffers from the serious scaling issues, and the transaction costs have increased a lot lately, the decision was made to implement the functionality on top of Ethereum network. If the goals of the campaign are met, the plan is to have that implementation within 3 months.
The initial implementation will use Ethereum tokens to represent EVCPLUS assets being traded/transfered, which will be created by EVCCOIN. The implementation will allow to do a one-click transfer from ETH to EVCPLUS, and will be extendable to allow other mobile payment solutions to be integrated later.
